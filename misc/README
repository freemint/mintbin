The files in this subdirectory are here because they don't fit
into another.

The shell script nm-wrapper is a wrapper script around broken
nm programs.  If your nm responds to the option -V with an
endless loop saying ``illegal option -- -V'' you will need
it.  Rename your nm to ``nm-old'' and install ``nm-wrapper''
as ``nm''.

If you don't have a working ranlib program or script installed
you can install the script provided here.

Both nm-wrapper and ranlib are used when you want to bootstrap
the GNU binutils.

You may add the file magic.add to your /etc/magic in case your
file command fails to detect MiNT executables.
